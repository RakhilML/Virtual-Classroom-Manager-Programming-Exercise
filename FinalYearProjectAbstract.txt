Phenotyping of flowers is very essential in botany as well as in the field of agriculture especially in plant breeding and production. Most conventional 
approaches tend to be slow and highly dependent on manual work hence likely to have a lot of inconsistencies. To overcome these challenges, the advanced 
neural networks is employed with an aim of providing a automated solution. This framework includes developing and pre-processing the dataset, training 
deep learning model, and making estimations in real time reports on flower phenology. Thus, it allows for the improvement of these processes by automating 
them with the help of this proposed solution of phenotyping for increased efficiency and accuracy in the assessment of plant health. This approach has 
the potential of being incorporated with the use of robotic systems for crop management, improving efficiency of agricultural management as an 
organisational goal. The subsequent development of this system could open possibilities for direct control and monitoring of operations in agriculture and 
lead to crop management and yield.
